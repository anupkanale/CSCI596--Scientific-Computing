To run the hybrid mpi-omp-cuda computation of pi, use the following:

	mpicc -o pi3 -Xcompiler -fopenmp pi3.cu
	cat $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq > nodefile
	mpirun -np 2 -machinefile nodefile ./pi3 --bind-to none 

NOTE: The right version of cuda and omp also have to be configured. But this varies from system to system.
